## Code Explanation

The code for The Legend EA MT5 consists of the following sections:

### Import necessary libraries

The code imports the necessary libraries for trading, state evaluation, and market trend analysis. These libraries include Trade, NNM, and QML.

### Define variables

The code defines three variables: `trade`, `nnm`, and `qml`. 

- `trade` is an object of the `CTrade` class, which is used for executing trades.
- `nnm` is an object of the `CNNM` class, which is used for state evaluation.
- `qml` is an object of the `CQML` class, which is used for market trend analysis.

### Initialize the EA

The `OnInit` function is called when the EA is initialized. In this function, the expert magic number for trades is set using the `SetExpertMagicNumber` method of the `CTrade` object.

### Execute trading operations

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick. It checks for trade signals by evaluating the state using the `EvaluateState` method of the `CNNM` object and predicting the market trend using the `PredictMarketTrend` method of the `CQML` object. If both conditions are met, a buy trade is executed using the `Buy` method of the `CTrade` object. If neither condition is met, a sell trade is executed using the `Sell` method of the `CTrade` object.

### Handle trade events

The `OnTrade` function is called when trade events occur. It checks if a trade has been closed using the `IsTradeClosed` method of the `CTrade` object. If a trade has been closed, it prints the trade result to the journal using the `Print` function.

### Stop the EA

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the EA is stopped. It prints the reason for stopping the EA to the journal using the `Print` function.
